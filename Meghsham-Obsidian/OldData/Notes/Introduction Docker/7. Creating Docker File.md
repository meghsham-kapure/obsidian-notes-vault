## **🛠 Steps to Build a Basic Docker Image**

You don’t need a full project—just a single `Dockerfile`.

### **1️⃣ Create a Directory and Move Into It**

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
mkdir my-docker-test

cd my-docker-test

touch Dockerfile

nano Dockerfile
```

This step is optional, but it helps keep things clean.

---

### **2️⃣ Create a Simple Dockerfile**

Inside your empty directory, create a new file named **`Dockerfile`** and add the following:

```dockerfile
# Use a small Linux base image
FROM alpine:latest

# Set a default command
CMD ["echo", "Hello from my first Docker image!"]
```

---

### **3️⃣ Build the Docker Image**

Run the following command in the same directory where your `Dockerfile` is located:

```bash
docker build -t my-first-image .
```

### **💡 Explanation**

- `docker build` → Command to create an image
- `-t my-first-image` → Assigns the name `my-first-image`
- `.` → Specifies the current directory as the build context

After running this, you should see a success message confirming the image was created.

---

### **4️⃣ Run the Image as a Container**

Now, let’s run the container from the newly built image:

```bash
docker run my-first-image
```

### **✅ Expected Output:**

```
Hello from my first Docker image!
```

---

### **5️⃣ List Your Docker Images**

To see all locally built images, run:

```bash
docker images
```

---

### **6️⃣ Clean Up (Optional)**

If you want to remove the image after testing:

```bash
docker rmi my-first-image
```

## **🎯 What You Learned**

✔ Created a **Dockerfile**  
✔ Built a **Docker image**  
✔ Ran the image as a **container**  
✔ Used `CMD` to define a **default command**
