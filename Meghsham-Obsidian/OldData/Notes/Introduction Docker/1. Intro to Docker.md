# Before Docker
Problem :
1. a application is deployed on a server and it was used by multiple users 
2. if the developer requires to launch / deploy another application they need to setup and run another server
Solution By VMware : VMware came up with VIRTUALIZATION as solution that can run multiple application on the same server but the applications need their own operating system that can have issues resource requirement and licencing and other stuff so even it was better thing to do but not the best in some cases.

Another Problem was "Its not working on my machine!!!" this was due resource and cofig differences.

 So DOCKER solve all of this issue with use of ISOLATED CONTAINERS which has all the required things, libraries and configuration etc.

As you can see virtual machines use HYPERVISOR is used to create child operating system and manage them with resource available on HOST and every application created under new GUEST OS but in Container there is only one Operating System and Container Engine is managing the different application.

# Docker and Container
**Docker :** Docker is a platform that enables developers to package, deploy, and run applications in isolated environments known as containers. It simplifies the process of managing software dependencies, ensuring that an application will run the same way regardless of the environment it's being deployed in (whether that's a developer's machine, a staging server, or production).

**Containers**: A container is a lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient unit that contains everything needed to run an application. This includes the application code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies. Containers are isolated from the host system and other containers, which makes them highly portable and consistent across different environments.

**Images**: Docker uses images to create containers. An image is a blueprint or template for creating containers. It contains everything needed to run an application, and multiple containers can be instantiated from a single image.

**Docker Engine**: This is the runtime that enables running containers. It consists of a server-side component (the Docker Daemon) and a client-side component (the Docker CLI).

**Docker Hub**: A cloud-based registry that allows you to store and share Docker images. You can pull images from the hub or push your own custom images.

**Dockerfile**: A text file containing instructions on how to build a Docker image. This file defines the environment, software, and configurations required to run your application.

NOTE : Containers are tightly coupled with the underlying OS kernel, which is why they require the same OS to function—Linux containers need Linux, and Windows containers need Windows.
