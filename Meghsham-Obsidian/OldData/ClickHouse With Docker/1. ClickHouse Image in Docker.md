1. **Pull ClickHouse image:**
    
    ```
    docker pull clickhouse
    ```
    
    This command downloads the official ClickHouse Docker image from Docker Hub.
    
2. **Check available Docker images:**
    
    ```
    docker images
    ```
    
    This lists all Docker images available on your system.
    
3. **Run ClickHouse container:**
    
    ```
    docker run -d --name clickhouse-db clickhouse
    ```
    
    This starts a ClickHouse container in detached mode, naming it `clickhouse-db`.
    
4. **Connect to ClickHouse instance using the client:**
    
    ```
    docker run -it --network=container:clickhouse-db --entrypoint clickhouse-client clickhouse
    ```
    
    This starts a temporary ClickHouse client that connects to the running `clickhouse-db` container.

Inside ClickHouse CLI:

1. **Create database and table:**
    
    ```
    CREATE DATABASE analytics;
    USE analytics;
    
    CREATE TABLE transactionDemo (
      TransactionId VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
      MerchantId VARCHAR,
      MerchantName VARCHAR,
      Status VARCHAR,
      PaymentMethod VARCHAR,
      AuthStatus VARCHAR,
      AdditionalInfo1 VARCHAR,
      AdditionalInfo2 VARCHAR,
      TransactionDate VARCHAR,
      TxnAmount DOUBLE
    );
    ```
    
    Here, you create a new database called `analytics` and a table `transactionDemo` with the specified columns. You set `TransactionId` as the primary key.
    
2. **Exit ClickHouse CLI:**
    
    ```
    EXIT;
    ```
    
    This exits the ClickHouse client.

3. **Copy CSV file into the container:**
    
    ```
    docker cp /home/meghsham.kapure/Downloads/Transaction_All.csv clickhouse-db:/mnt/Transaction_All.csv
    ```
    
    This copies your CSV file `Transaction_All.csv` from your local machine into the container at `/mnt/Transaction_All.csv`.
    
4. **Connect back to ClickHouse container:**
    
    ```
    docker exec -it clickhouse-db clickhouse-client
    ```
    
    This starts a new ClickHouse client inside the running container.
    
5. **Insert data into the table:**
    
    ```
    INSERT INTO analytics.transactionDemo FROM INFILE '/mnt/Transaction_All.csv' FORMAT CSV;
    ```
    
    This command imports the CSV data into the `transactionDemo` table.
    
6. **Select all data to verify the insertion & count the records instered:**
    
    ```
    select * from analytics.transactionDemo;
    ```

	```shell
	SELECT count(*) FROM analytics.transactionDemo;
	```
    This will display all the records that were inserted into the table.
