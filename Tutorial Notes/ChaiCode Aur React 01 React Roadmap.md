React Roadmap

- Why React
    - Hyped & trending, job oriented
    - Easier to manage and build complex UI

- When should we learn React
    - After mastering JS
    - In projects where you need to achieve more than simpler UI

- React History
    - Facebook had some issues with UI where it could not reset the notification counter after notification was read as state was not manipulated and synced with DOM. This problem was the Ghost Problem for Facebook.
    - Dan Abramov is a founding member of the React team at Meta (formerly Facebook) and is best known for co-authoring Redux and creating Create React App.
    - It is an open-source library, adopted by KHAN ACADEMY and UNSPLASH first.

- Learning React Pedagogy
    - Go in-depth concept by concept
    - Go project by project and then learn underlying concepts

- Framework vs Library
    - React is a library focusing more on functionalities rather than strict rules
    - Angular is a framework which has strict type-checked language

- Topics to learn
    - React Core: State and JSX
    - Component Reusability (Props)
    - How changes propagate (hooks)

- Additional Add-ons to React (not proprietary to React things)
    - Router
    - State management: Redux, Redux toolkit, Zustand, context API
    - Class-based components (legacy code)
    - Backend As Service apps: social media apps, e-commerce apps

- Post React
    - Going full-stack
    - Framework: NEXT JS (FE and BE), Gatsby, Remix
